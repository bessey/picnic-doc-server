This is the 'master bot' client that runs on the server, along side it effectively as a chat bot.

It is a pain to compile, and unfortunately we can't just create a make file for you
as it uses so many odd libraries. The binaries are also scattered through the directory structure
and add up to ~500MB so we've had to include only the source code we were actually responsible
for writing.
